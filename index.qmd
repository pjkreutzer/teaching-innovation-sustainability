# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is the website for my teaching involvement in "Innovation for Sustainable Development" taught at the Economic History Department, Lund in HT 2022.

The content is split between seminars and a lecture.
The seminars are participation based and hence do not include much information apart from some basic notes on what is expected and links to additional resources.
For the lecture you can find the slides and an accompanying script.
Please note that these are only written out notes.
They should not be cited in any work.
