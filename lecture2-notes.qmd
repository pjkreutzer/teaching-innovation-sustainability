This lecture aims to explore what sustainability means for innovation.
Taking a social science perspective, we will discuss issues of directionality, power, and agency in defining sustainability transitions.

The required reading for this class is @garud2012MetatheoreticalPerspectivesSustainability.
When reading think about how the different perspectives presented relate to innovation systems and innovation policy.
What do you think about the compatibility of different theories?

Further recommended readings are @geels2010OntologiesSociotechnicalTransitions,@holmgren2022WhoseTransformationThis,
@parks2022DirectionalityTransformativeInnovation,
@grillitsch2019InnovationPolicySystemwide.
Please keep in mind that you should not aim to read all the papers, rather they were chosen to represent current thinking of sustainability in (European) sustainability transition research.
When reading any of them, think about how they relate to the different ideas of sustainability in @garud2012MetatheoreticalPerspectivesSustainability.
Is one idea over-represented?
If so, why do you think this is the case?
Do you see any problems with it?
:::

## Directionality

Solve the big social challenges with innovation TM.
Directionality as "promoting speicifc inovations that contrbute to a rparticular direction of transfrommative change" @parks2022DirectionalityTransformativeInnovation

Is the direction clear?

## Wicked Problems

Do we know what to solve?

### Sustainability -- Concept and Aspects

If there are too few other lectures where the natural science basis of sustainability challenges are introduced, this might be an opportunity to catch up a bit.


Therefore, transformative change must be in the direction of sustainability.
While we will cover what sustainability means for innovation more in my next lecture, I do want to quickly introduce three different ways of thinking about sustainability here.
