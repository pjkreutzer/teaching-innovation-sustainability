    "section": "2.1 Three Frames for Innovation",
    "text": "2.1 Three Frames for Innovation\nOver time the focus of innovation policy has shifted. The literature talks about different frames for innovation research and policy (Schot and Steinmueller 2018; European Commission, Directorate General for Research and Innovation 2020).\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Three Frames of Innovation\n\n\nThe first frame discussed in Schot and Steinmueller (2018) is innovation for growth. This frame was particularly influential in the post-war period and can be identified in Kuznets’ (1966)Modern Economic Growth. Note the reasons for why countries were willing to invest into science: to fight off unwanted economic events (inflation, unemployment, instability); spillovers into private sector; peace through defense spending. Often the spending was clearly defined with a mission in mind. Examples are winning the space race in the 1960s, or lessening the exposure to oil exporting nations in the 1970s. Within this frame the question of how to design markets optimally was at the heart of innovation policy. As you recall from economics of innovation, it is argued that market failures exist in the provision of discovery and invention. Overcoming these failures in the early stages of the innovation process (i.e., at the basic research and invention stage) trough public spending was the solution. In this framing technological progress is mainly viewed as positive. While negative possibilities are acknowledged, the positive elements outweigh. Hence, selecting which innovation should be pursued plays only a minor role.\nThe second frame focuses on innovation from a systemic perspective. This frame emerged from the realization that not all lower income countries caught up and benefitted from the – supposed positive externalities of – innovation developed in high income countries. Institutions at various scales play the central role in this frame. Innovation as a linear process is replaced with a convoluted, feedback driven systemic event. The main goal of innovation remains economic. Due to international competition the imperative to innovate in order to stay competitive increases too. Failure to provide innovation at a desired level is countered with systemic intervention. For example, by providing networking events, or creating collaboration programs. Such programs, however, have a mixed track record. Innovation is too complex to simply “copy-paste” the silicon valley elsewhere.\nThe third and most recent frame is that of innovation as means to achieve social transformation. Its core assumption is still that innovation is a “… force for creating a better world” (Schot and Steinmueller 2018, 1561). This third frame calls the narrative of innovation as always positive (even when it destroys something cf. Schumpeter and Elliott (2012)) into question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\nWhat do you think about the three frames for innovation? Do they build on one another, or do they replace the previous? How about their timing? Is each frame a novel addition? \nWhich frame do you think best describes the game we played in the seminar? \nSchot and Steinmueller (2018) mention the three frames in the context of STI (Science, Technology and Innovation) policy. At a seminar someone remarks that all these three are indeed very different and need different policy. What do you respond?\n\n\nThe subject of transformation are socio-technical systems, or what Schot and Steinmueller (2018) call the backbones of modern societies (p. 1562). This requires more than new products or processes.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Iceberg of Types of Innovation\n\n\nFigure 2.2 depicts an iceberg of innovation types for sustainability. Above the water level, the most visible part of the iceberg, are organizational and technological innovations. Organizational innovations include changes in management, or strategy. Examples of technological innovation are both new processes and products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Technology Innovations\n\n\n\nThe fairphone, or IKEA’s better shelter are examples of product innovations. Process innovations include examples such as the app Too Good To Go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Organizational Innovations\n\n\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility Reports are an example of organizational innovations. Another example are carbon emission audits.\n\n\nThe first level below the water line are social and formal intuitions. Innovations at this level are, for example, changes in lifestyle or consumer behaviors – these are social in nature – or changes in laws, regulations etc. The deepest and most invisible level in this metaphor are innovations in informal institutions. These include changes to norms, values and believes. For a paper that ties each of these innovations to climate change, give Otto et al. (2020) a read. Based on expert surveys, social tipping points with positive climate impacts are identified. The analysis includes estimations of the time horizons over which each level might change.\nWhen discussing innovation for sustainability it is helpful to remember that innovation is more then only the introduction of new process or products.\nThe iceberg heuristic provides a helpful tool to analyze the depth of a transition. Take, for example, the mobility sector. In many places there are ambitions to promote the use of electrical vehicles (EV). The vehicles themselves are a readily recognized technological innovation. Some cities have begun to set up charging stations along parking spaces to promote switching to EV. This likely required changes to local laws or the creation of other new formal institutions. Similarly, longer “refueling” times of EV require users to adapt their behavior and for some even changes in their lifestyles. Innovation therefore goes beyond the readily visible top of the iceberg. But what about the deepest level? Some critiques argue that EV do not lead to a deep transition of the mobility sector, as the norm remains focused on providing individual transport solutions.\nOnly such transformation of the deepest levels is considered by Schot and Steinmueller (2018) as a socio-technical system transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransition or Transformation\n\n\n\nNote that in the literature transition and transformation are used differently by different authors (Hölscher, Wittmayer, and Loorbach 2018).\nIn the transformation literature, transitions are a fluent change towards slightly improved but fundamentally consistent systems. Transformations, on the other hand are fundamentally different, radical and non-linear changes to a system Roggema, Vermeend, and Timmermans (2012). This is the concept Mazzucato (2018) refers to when discussing missions aimed at generating transformations.\nIn the transitions literature, transformations are one possible pathway for transitions Geels and Schot (2007). Transformations happen when there is moderate landscape pressure on the regime. The socio-technical regime responds by moving development paths and innovation into the direction of the pressure.\n\n\nIn the third frame, the goal of social transformation is to address a specific issue society faces.\nOne issue of global scale is the overshoot of planetary boundaries. Rockström et al. (2009) introduced this concept and identified nine biophysical processes which regulate the Earth System into the current stable state under which humanity began to thrive. They indicate a safe operating space for humanity and reflect early warnings that a system state changing threshold might soon be reached (Steffen et al. 2015). Climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, ocean acidification, atmospheric aerosol loading, land-system change, freshwater use, biochemical flows, biosphere integrity, and novel entities, these are the planetary boundaries. Since the 1950s, in a period dubbed the Great Acceleration, pressure on the planetary boundaries has increased dramatically (Figure 2.4; Steffen et al. (2011)). Wang-Erlandsson et al. (2022) have been the latest to measure how close we are to transgressing planetary boundaries (Figure 2.3). Including their assessment of freshwater, we know now that we have overshoot six of the nine boundaries.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Planetary Boundaries Model (Azote for Stockholm Resilience Centre, based on analysis in Persson et al. (2022) and Steffen et al. (2015)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: The Great Acceleration reprinted from Steffen et al. (2011).\n\n\nThe planetary boundaries focus on environmental sustainability. We will dive deeper into these topics in my second lecture. In the mean time the Lund University MOOC “Working for a sustainable future: concepts and approaches” is a great resource to learn about key sustainability concepts. It also features videos on innovation for sustainability by Cristina Chaminade. These two lectures draw heavily from her previous work with this course.\nBut transformative innovation does not only target environmental issues. Population aging, education, or hunger are other areas in which innovation is needed to find a solution. A popular and important framework for addressing important issues are the Sustainable Development Goals. The SDG themselves are an important innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\nWhat kind of innovation are the SDG?\n\n\nSchot and Steinmueller (2018) highlight that the three frames build on one-another, emerging into discourse to different extents. This raises an important aspect for translating the frames into practice. Many researchers and policy makers have been educated when the first, or second frame were the most prominent. The call for innovation to be a force for good, is itself an informal institutional innovation. It calls many previous believes about innovation (policy) into question.\nIn the second section of this lecture we will examine one of the most vocal advocates for a deep change in believes about what innovation policy can and should do."

    "section": "2.2 Top Down Change Policy – Mission Orientation",
    "text": "2.2 Top Down Change Policy – Mission Orientation\nMazzucato (2018) summarizes one of the most influential current innovation policy paradigms. She argues that the grand-challenges of our time need to be taken on by national governments. The scale of many issues (e.g. Figure 2.4), she argues, requires that resources are mobilized at equally large scales.\nMany of these grand challenges are novel in so far, as there is a high urgency for solving them. The previous reactionary view of the first and second innovation frame, Weber and Rohracher (2012) argue, are not enough to provide answers for modern problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\nSchot and Steinmueller (2018) question briefly wether transformative change is too ambitious of a target for STI policy. What do you think?\nWhat do you think Mazzucato (2018) responds to the question?\n\n\nIndeed, for Mazzucato (2018) the government should not be passive at all. Instead of waiting for markets to form, fail and only then regulate, or for limited intervention in systems, mission oriented policy calls for a government which proactively engages in the innovation process and indeed economy at large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\nLet us return to the types of innovation introduced earlier. What type of innovation do you think Mazzucato (2018) advocates (most) for?\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Implementing Mission Policies\nShe proposes mission maps as a tool to visualize mission oriented policies. The process of a mission map attempts to turn the first and second frame thinking on its head. Instead of asking what should be done to improve innovation, the starting question in missions is what should be done to solve the problem. The emphasis is therefore not on picking winners in the sense of deciding from the start what innovation should be adopted, but picking those willing to accomplish the mission.\nMissions have become a part of EU legislation in the from of EU Horizon Programmes (Mazzucato 2021). They are also present at various scales in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, but also cities such as Amsterdam. This raises some important questions about the extent to which the missions are socially co-developed. How are shared visions created? Who decides what goals are worth to pursue? Are we pushing political problems into the technical sphere, by crafting innovation missions around them? For this last question, lets return to the example of electrical vehicles as a part of more sustainable transport sector. Mazzucato (2021) highlights investments of the Obama administration into Tesla Motors as a successful example of state led risk capital. While Tesla is currently a company enjoying economic success, and the sector at large seems to grow, we do have to stop and consider: whose vision of a sustainable transport sector includes luxury electrical vehicles? Who is not included in this vision? Are there other potential visions for future mobility?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\nMazzucato (2018) argues the government should take a more proactive role in innovation. Schot and Steinmueller (2018) state that the third innovation frame requires “[inclusively] deliberating and exploring … social and environmental goals and underlying values” (p. 1563-1564). Are these combinable, when, how?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFurther Reading: If you are looking for a more in-depth exploration of mission economy thinking, Mazzucato (2021) is a quick and accessible read."

    "section": "2.3 Bottom Up Change Policy – Multi-Level Perspective",
    "text": "2.3 Bottom Up Change Policy – Multi-Level Perspective\nOne of the most influential theories in transition studies is the Multi-level perspective. The MLP is deeply routed in Science, Technology and Society Studies, Evolutionary Economics and draws heavily on historical case studies. It is compromised of three analytical concepts: the landscape, socio-technical regimes and niche-innovation (Geels and Schot 2007). Figure 2.5 depicts an often used sketch illustration of how these concepts interact.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: The Multi-Level Perspective Reprinted from Geels (2011) p. 28\n\n\nLet us step through it from the top to the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the landscape?\nWhat is the regime?\nWhat is the niche?\n\n\n\nThe sociotechnical landscape forms the exogenous background against which niche and regime actors operate. The events here are outside of the immediate control of both the regime and the niche, often unfold over long time horizons but exert pressure on the regime (Geels and Schot 2007). When you think of landscape, think about deep cultural patterns, macro-political developments etc.\nThe sociotechnical regime is routed in the evolutionary economic work of Nelson and Winter (2004) and their technological regimes (the cited edition in Geels (2007) is from 1982) . Sociotechnical regimes are shared cognitive routines of all those involved with a given technology. This includes users, policy makers, as well as companies and engineers (Geels and Schot 2007).\nNiche innovation are novel, initially unstable configurations developed at the micro level. Often they are developed by small networks of agents at the periphery of a system.\n\n2.3.1 Transitions of Socio-Technical Systems\nIn the MLP, there are different ways in which a socio-technical system can change, or rather, undergo a transition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nA transition is a\n\nradical, structural change of a societal subsystem that is the result of co-evolution of economic, cultural, technological, ecological and institutional developments at different scale-levels.(Grin, Rotmans, and Schot 2010, 108)\n\n\n\n\nOverview of Transition Typologies (Geels and Schot 2007, 414)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransition pathways\nMain actors\nType of (inter)actions\nKey words\n\n\n\n\n1. Transformation\nRegime actors and outside groups (social movements)\nOutsiders voice criticism. Incumbent actors adjust regime rules (goals, guiding principles, search heuristics)\nOutside pressure, institutional power struggles, negotiations, adjustment of regime rules\n\n\n2. Technological substitution\nIncumbent firms versus new firms\nNewcomers develop novelties, which compete with regime technologies\nMarket competition and power struggles between old and new firms\n\n\n3. Reconfiguration\nRegime actors and suppliers\nRegime actors adopt component-innovations, developed by new suppliers. Competition between old and new suppliers\nCumulative component changes, because of economic and functional reasons. Followed by new combinations, changing interpretations and new practices\n\n\n4. De-alignment and re-alignment\nNew niche actors\nChanges in deep structures create strong pressure on regime. Incumbents lose faith and legitimacy. Followed by emergence of multiple novelties. New entrants compete for resources, attention and legitimacy. Eventually one novelty wins, leading to restabilisation of regime\nErosion and collapse, multiple novelties, prolonged uncertainty and changing interpretations, new winner and restabilisation\n\n\n\nThe MLP, as well as, innovation systems at their various scales have become backdrops against which research is being carried out (Truffer et al. 2022). This does not mean that they have become less influential – far from it – but rather that they are not necessarily referenced in the precise manner in which they were conceived. For my own research, as an example, the ideas of a regime resisting change is very influential. But rather than viewing niche innovations as the main source of change, I am interested in how the regime is influencing the directionality (e.g., by legitimizing certain visions for the future) of the transition. We will come back to these questions in the second lecture, were we will be looking at the emerging bioeconomy and what sustainability means for transitions.\nBecause the MLP puts such an heavy emphasis on innovation from protected niches, early ideas focused on strategic niche management (SNM) (Geels and Schot 2007). Later iterations have focused more on other aspects of the model, such as regime and landscape changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\nThe assigned reading Geels (2011) responds to several criticisms presented towards the MLP for sustainability transitions. Do you think they were convincingly refuted? If not, why not?\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Current Questions\nWhile the origins of the model are fading from citations to some extent (Truffer et al. 2022), they still form an influential shared knowledge base for transition studies. Many questions are still being explored with the MLP framework, which we will not cover here. Example questions on the agenda are how to destabilize regimes (e.g., Frank and Schanz 2022), how multiple regimes interact (e.g., Rosenbloom 2020), and how regimes interact at different scales (e.g., Fuenfschilling and Binz 2018)."

    "text": "2.4 Discussion and Reflection\nUsing innovation to address grand challenges, sustainability or wicked problems, is surely needed. But not in the traditional way of thinking about innovation as a neutral at worst and positive at best force. Recasting innovation as synonymous with change and capable of deeply transforming our society opens new ways for policy makers.\nTransformative innovation policy agrees that shared visions are needed and that they ought to be legitimized by broad participation (Haddad et al. 2022). But the question of how to do that is remains a central challenge. Even within highly mature innovation systems such as NIS in EU states or the US, the question of how to govern transition innovation policy is far from answered. In addition, some authors have already pointed out that innovation research itself needs to become more diverse (e.g., Preuß et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\nWhat do you think about the last statement regarding the first innovation frame in Schot and Steinmueller (2018), that first frame innovation addresses symptoms? What is now being addressed in development studies?\n\n\nIn Haddad et al. (2022) a concise review of transformative innovation policy (TIP) and its two biggest versions (MOIP and MLP) comes to the conclusion that much work remains to be done for these ideas to become viable tools for policy makers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\nSchot and Steinmueller (2018) argue that the third frame, unlike the first two innovation frames, explicitly calls for a collaboration between the Global North and South. But Preuß et al. (2021) raises questions about the diversity of transition studies. What do you think?\n\n\nWhat do you think about the time and context of innovation? Can you envision the type of silo-free, quick moving mission innovation in non-(mature) democracies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOn the challenges of developing national innovation systems, their role for sustainable development and more, suggested reading Chaminade (2018)  Advanced Introduction to National Innovation Systems."

    "text": "3 What Does Sustainability Mean for Innovation?\nIn the previous lecture we discussed different ways in which innovation is involved in sustainability transitions. We have discussed more descriptive approaches to think about this question, such as the informal ice-berg heuristic and the well established Multi-level perspective. We have also discussed more normative approaches such as Mission Oriented Innovation Policy and begun discussing why we have to take the normative dimension seriously in innovation for sustainability.\nIn this lecture, we are going to look more in depth at why and how to account for normative complexity in sustainability transitions and what that implies for innovation. We will first introduce some key concepts, hopefully you have already encountered them, so that we only need to do a short refresher. Then we will use these to discuss what innovation is sustainable, or rather under what circumstances it is and for whom.\nAt the end, you can find an introduction to my own research project, to see one example of how these topics enter the transition to the bioeconomy."

    "section": "3.2 Sustainability Dimensions",
    "text": "3.2 Sustainability Dimensions\nSustainability as a concept is not the outcome of scientific research. Instead, it is grounded in ethics and has no single true solution (Michelsen et al. 2016). Of course this does not mean that scientific research has nothing to add to sustainability, far from it! Natural science, the humanities, social sciences, all have important contributions to furthering our understanding and pursuit of sustainability. That is why it is important to critically engage with the concept from various angles.\nHumans have for a very long time thought about sustainability and how to behave in a way that is compatible with nature. In a Western context, the German Hans Carl von Carlowitz, is often credited for popularizing the term “nachhaltende Nutzung” (enduring, or sustainable usage), of forests in the 1713 work Sylvicultura Oeconomica. He argued that foresters should only remove as many trees a year as reach maturity in the same year (Michelsen et al. 2016).\nRemember that the idea, to only use as much from nature as it can restore, has been a central imperative of many cultures and traditions, long before German forest owners implemented the idea for their property. This already points to an important aspect of sustainability. The concept of sustainability has been developed, adopted and adapted, sometimes even forgotten, by people in different places and different times. In the Anthropocene Rockström et al. (2009) argue, humans need to develop a novel type of sustainability knowledge. With human activity affecting the Earth System at a planetary scale, some scientist articulate the need for humanity to become planetary stewards. On a sub-planetary scale, many Indigenous people have long been recognized as exceptional stewards of ecosystems. This highlights that knowledge about sustainable human nature interaction has existed outside of Western knowledge sets for much longer than 300 years. Bridging Indigenous knowledge with Western knowledge sets is a difficult challenge which lays bare many core issues of sustainability (Johnson et al. 2016), some of which we will discuss in this lecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\nHow does the fact that Garud and Gehman (2012) discuss different perspectives of sustainability journeys fit into the idea of sustainability as a social process?\nCan you spot differences that arise for ethical questions from the three metatheoretical perspectives discussed in the assigned reading?\n\n\nWith the UN conferences in Stockholm, 1972, and Rio de Janiero, 1992, the increased public attention on environmental harm fully arrived in the the global political arena (Michelsen et al. 2016). Already at the Stockholm conference, different visions of sustainable development became apparent. While representatives of the Global North were concerned with environmental pollution of industrial activity, members of the Global South raised the importance of social and economic development (Michelsen et al. 2016).\n\n3.2.1 Sustainable Development\n\nSustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. (Environment and Development 1987).\n\nThis quote is probably familiar to you already. It does a good job at highlighting the intra- and inter-generational nature of sustainability. But it has also been criticized on various grounds. Among theme is the focus on human needs alone, along with remaining questions what needs are in the first place. In the context of this lecture, it points us to a central question: how do we determine the needs of present and future generations? The assumptions we make in answering this question play a substantial role in how we assess technology, innovation and (economic) development.\nThe needs of present and future generations are often thought of as falling into the three dimensions discussed at the above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\nHow do the different perspectives of Garud and Gehman (2012) relate to the intergenerational issue of sustainability raised in the above definition of sustainable development?\nDo you think all perspectives engage with this aspect to the same extent?\n\n\nThe environment, society and the economy are the three dimensions of sustainability. But they are frequently given different priority. Figure 3.1 shows three ways in which the dimensions can be organized. The first being an equal representation as pillars upon which the concept sustainability lays. The second representation, sometimes dubbed the “Mickey Mouse Model” due to its resemblance to the characters head shape, places economic aspects at the center, while environmental and social considerations take on the role of smaller add-ons. Lastly, the nested model places economic aspects within social aspects within environmental aspects. The argument being that without a natural environment there is no society without which there is no economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPillars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMickey Mouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNested\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Three Dimensions of Sustainability\n\n\nThese representations can also be spotted in connection with the SDG. Figure 3.2 shows the SDG organized as equal blocks and as a nested model, where economic goals sit inside social goals inside ecological goals. Such representation may seem arbitrary, but the mental models we make of our world can be hugely influential in our way of navigating the world. And a model does not necessarily have to be a formalized set of mathematical equations!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNested SDG Model (Azote for Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SDG Grid Poster (UN)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Depictions of the SDG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor an interesting discussion of this have a look at this conversation between Kate Raworth and Herman Daly.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Weak and Strong Sustainability\nAssigning sustainability dimensions different importance does not only come into play in the figures above. How we “order” the importance of different dimensions is a crucial departure point for any analysis. It determines what we direct our attention to, how we engage with it and the type of conclusions we draw based on the research. The nested model corresponds to a notion of strong sustainability, while the pillars and mickey mouse model representation correspond to weak notions of sustainability. The primary difference between weak and strong sustainability is the question what should be preserved in the long run.\nWeak sustainability maintains that it is total capital which should be preserved. Total capital is the sum of human made and natural capital, including natural resources, both cultivated (e.g., forests, or farmland) and uncultivated (e.g., air), manufactured, human, social and knowledge capital (Michelsen et al. 2016). Within total capital, everything is substitutable. What matters is that the utility between different forms remains the same. That means that a natural lake can not only be replaced by a swimming pool, but that this may even be the best thing to do, if the total welfare provided by the swimming pool is larger than that of the lake (Michelsen et al. 2016).\nThe fact that sustainability is an inter- and intra-generational concept, with teleconnections (i.e., activity at one location affects other locations) and multi scale impacts, makes it crucial what assumptions underlie our thinking. The assumptions of weak sustainability cloud important questions which arise from sustainability being an ethically grounded concept. Who decides what the value of a forest is? The people selling its timber? The people dependent on hunting its game? Those who benefit from its regulating services, such as protection against soil erosion or flood? Or those who have a cultural tie to the specific forest?\nStrong sustainability on the other hand, maintains that it is not possible to substitute natural capital. Natural capital is only rarely interchangeable with other forms of capital. Some would even argue that the idea of substitutability is wrong in the first place (Michelsen et al. 2016). This means that even within strong sustainability, there may be disagreement. Returning to the lake example, strong sustainability advocates would agree that replacing a lake with a swimming pool is not sustainable. But for some restoring wetlands at a different site could be considered as an option. Others would disagree with this as a “solution” on the basis that the lake has an inherent value, irrespective of humans, which will be lost together with the lake. These issues are pertinent in many current sustainability debates (e.g., Swedish forestry in Northern Sweden).\nTherefore, while weak and strong sustainability are often portrayed as distinct categories, it seems sensible to think of these concepts as a continuos spectrum (Figure 3.3, compare with the table in Michelsen et al. (2016) p. 19).\nIt follows that the concepts do not only differ in regards to their assumptions about the nature of capital and on the question what ought to be preserved in the long run, but also on worldviews. While weak sustainability places humans at the center of “the why”, strong sustainability questions the anthropocentrism and holds obligations to nature as a key motive.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Sustainability Spectrum\n\n\nFor a through critique of weak sustainability, have a look at Ott (2019)."

    "text": "3.3 Sustainable Technology\nWhen thinking about the sustainability of individual technologies, the fact that sustainability is a multi-facetted topic makes assessment very challenging.\nGarcía-Granero, Piedra-Muñoz, and Galdeano-Gómez (2018) review the literature on eco-innovation. From their review they compile a list of eco-innovation types across four dimensions: product, process, organizational, and marketing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nExactly what an eco-innovation is, is difficult to define. But two aspects emerge as common ground:\n“…fewer adverse effects on the environment and more efficient use of resources” (García-Granero, Piedra-Muñoz, and Galdeano-Gómez 2018, 305).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Eco-Innovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Eco-innovation classes (García-Granero, Piedra-Muñoz, and Galdeano-Gómez 2018, 309–11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\n\n\n\n101\nUse new cleaner material or new input with lower environmental impact\n\n\n102\nUse of recycled materials\n\n\n103\nReduction / optimization of raw material use\n\n\n104\nComponent number reduction\n\n\n105\nElimination of dirty components\n\n\n106\nLonger life cycle products\n\n\n107\nRecyclability of product\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess\n\n\n\n201\nReduce Chemical Waste\n\n\n202\nReduce Use of Water\n\n\n203\nReduce Use of Energy\n\n\n204\nKeep waste to a minimum\n\n\n205\nReuse of components\n\n\n206\nRecycle waste, water or materials\n\n\n207\nEnvironmental-friendly technologies\n\n\n208\nR&D\n\n\n209\nAcquisition of machinery and software\n\n\n210\nAcquisition of patents and licenses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizational\n\n\n\n301\nGreen human resources\n\n\n302\nPollution prevention plans\n\n\n303\nEnvironmental objectives\n\n\n304\nEnvironmental audit\n\n\n305\nEnvironmental advisory\n\n\n306\nInvest in research\n\n\n307\nCooperation with stakeholders\n\n\n308\nNew markets\n\n\n309\nNew systems (remanufacturing systems and transport systems)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing\n\n\n\n401\nReturnable/reusable packaging\n\n\n402\nGreen design packaging\n\n\n403\nQuality certifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut eco-innovation are not necessarily sustainable. Beemsterboer and Kemp (2016) argue that assessing the sustainability of technology can be approached as a yard stick, examining the impact a technology has on sustainability criteria. But as the concept of sustainability requires normative choices of what we value, we should not label technology as sustainable or unsustainable. Let us try to unpack why that might be the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\nAfter having read Garud and Gehman (2012), do you agree with the statement by Beemsterboer and Kemp (2016)?\n\n\nFirst, recall that the different dimensions of sustainability can also help us in our approach to sustainability issues. Assessing the sustainability of technology, for example, can be done from the vantage point of the environment. We can ask questions such as “what is the impact on the local ecosystem in which this technology will be used compared to alternative technology?”, but we can also ask social questions such as, “what is the impact of this technology on different recipients of services from the ecosystem?”.\nIn other words, technology assessment is always depended on the context in which it is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\nHow does context enter in the three perspectives of Garud and Gehman (2012)?\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Overview of Assessment Approaches\nTreating the many approaches to technology assessment in this lecture is impossible. Instead, this section focuses on discussing ways to approach assessment tools. What should researchers, policy makers, and other consumers and producers of sustainability assessments be aware of?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\nBeemsterboer and Kemp (2016, 73) have compiled an overview of different assessment methods with points of departure into relevant literature for each.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, they review technology assessment in regards to three goals. The first is to objectify the impact of a technology. This is frequently done using methods to quantify a specific aspect of the technology. The second is to uncover different perspectives of a technologies impact. Are different groups affected differently by it? Lastly, the impact of technology is coproduced with human activity. This means that it can be difficult to know on beforehand what the effects of a technology will be. For this Beemsterboer and Kemp (2016) provide the helpful example of a fridge. While fridges can help keep food fresh for longer, they may end up increasing the amount of food that goes to waste.\n\n3.3.1.1 Quantification and Objectification\nBoth the biophysical and the socio-economic effects of a technology can be assessed in a quantified manner.\nFor example, where it is possible to accurately include all relevant costs and benefits, a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) can guide policy makers on the optimal course of action. On many sustainability topics, however, it is at the very least extremely challenging to correctly identify and value (in monetary terms) costs and benefits (Ekins 2000).\nAnother example of methods aimed to help in the quantification of technology is Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA). The goal of this method is to compare the environmental effects of products and services across the entire product life; from extraction of raw materials to final disposal of the technology. Here too can the results lead to highly contested debates. Beemsterboer and Kemp (2016) report an example where a technology performs better in regards to CO2 emissions over its life cycle, but worse in regards to human toxicity.\nThis is not to say that methods that aim to quantify the effects of technologies are not useful or helpful. But relying on such methods can harm efforts to inform debates more than it aids. Different stakeholders may value some outcomes of technology differently from one-another. And this does not yet consider arguments about the inherent value of nature into consideration.\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Scenario and Dialogue Methods\nAttempts to include multiple perspectives can be an alternative to those methods attempting to objectify impact. For example, when monetary valuation of technological effects are difficult or impossible to obtain different scenarios can be developed both quantitatively and qualitatively and discussed among relevant stakeholders.\nSuch process, however, can quickly become complex as more and more perspectives are being included (Beemsterboer and Kemp 2016). At the same time, they do not guarantee that the outcome will be less contested. Beemsterboer and Kemp (2016) treat this issue more deeply and are worth a read if you are interested in this topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading Question\n\n\n\nCan you think about different ways in which technology assessment methods might be used within the different perspectives of Garud and Gehman (2012)?\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 The Method Is Never Neutral\nThe fact that sustainability is a multifaceted issue, requires any credible attempt to measure progress towards sustainability to account for these differences (Diaz-Balteiro, González-Pachón, and Romero 2017). The tools we choose to assess the impact, or sustainability of a tool necessarily require us to make choices. Choices about what to measure, how to measure, when and where to draw the boundaries etc. These choices are rarely the outcomes of theoretical considerations, but rather influenced by budget, and / or knowledge constraints (Gasparatos and Scolobig 2012).\nSome authors, such as Saltelli et al. (2020) extend the thought and propose that we need to accept this fact and instead of searching for the perfect tool, make use of different perspectives to critically examine insights derived from methods. In addition to several lenses that may help in this task, here are six rules presented in a previous paper (Saltelli et al. 2013) that may help you in examining the use of mathematical methods.\n\nRule 1: ‘Check against rhetorical use of mathematical modelling’; are results being over-interpreted? Is the model being used ritually or rhetorically?\n\n\nRule 2: ‘Adopt an “assumption hunting” attitude’; this would focus on unearthing possibly implicit assumptions.\n\n\nRule 3: ‘Detect pseudo-science’; this asks whether uncertainty has been downplayed, as discussed above, in order to present results in a more favourable light.\n\n\nRule 4: ‘Find sensitive assumptions before these find you’; this is a reminder that before publishing results the analysis of sensitivity should be done and made accessible to researchers.\n\n\nRule 5: ‘Aim for transparency’. This rule echoes present debates on open data, and of the need for a third party to be able to replicate a given analysis.\n\n\nRule 6: ‘Do the right sums’; the analysis should not solve the wrong problem – doing the right sums is more important than doing the sums right. This rule is about asking whether the given quantification is not neglecting important alternative ways to frame a given example.\n\n\nRule 7: ‘Focus the analysis on the key question answered by the model, exploring holistically the entire space of the assumptions’. (Saltelli et al. 2020, 91)."

Many visions for a sustainable future hinge on technological innovation. The most extreme are perhaps thoughts of geo-engineering, that is using technology to influence the atmosphere of planet Earth, or even terra-forming (e.g., creating a live sustaining atmosphere on) Mars.\nWhile carbon direct capture technology plays a role in climate mitigation efforts, it is is generally agreed that technology or command-control innovation is insufficient to address sustainable development questions. The solutions we need require extensive collective learning processes, with continuos adaptation over long periods (Wiek and Lang 2016). The fact that many environmental issues are becoming increasingly urgent may call into question if such long learning processes are acceptable.

    "text": "3.5 Summary\nSustainability is a wicked problem (Wanzenböck et al. 2020). This does not mean that there are no solutions to it. But it does mean that solutions are not easily identified, or simple yes or no constructs. Sustainability requires that we discuss, deliberate, explain and meet others, not once, but constantly. The fact that many sustainability issues are globally connected, operate at different scales and across different times certainly does not make it easier.\nTechnological change certainly is part of the answer(s). But there is reason to be cautious towards narratives of magic bullet technology. The effects of technology are difficult to assess and require us to be mindful of explicit and implicit assumptions, uncertainties and other methodological caveats which may cloud rather than clear our decision making.\nHow do we know if we have found a solution? Sustainability has a history of being easily defined as the antonmy of undesirable outcomes for humanity (Michelsen et al. 2016). The opposite of sustainability is collapse. While perhaps omitting that building a sustainable future, by definition, aims to create better lives, this negative definition may also help us in situations where it is difficult to explicate what is sustainable. Often it is easier to identify what is unsustainable. The aforementioned 1992 Earth Summit in Rio formulated the precautionary principle this way:\n\nWhere there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation. (United Nations 1992).\n\nThe burden to proof whether or not something is sustainable falls on those who propose that it is. This does not only apply to technologies but to other innovations too. In this lecture we covered different ways to acknowledge the normative dimension in thinking about technology and innovation. As you go on to deeply understand and use (some) of these methods, keep a critical stance. Once you learn how to use a hammer, you are tempted to think of every problem as a nail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nInitially the plan was to discuss a concrete example of the bioeconomy in this lecture.

    "text": "3.6 Sweden’s Transition to a Forest Bioeconomy\n\n3.6.1 Background\n\n3.6.1.1 Planetary Stewardship\nHumanity’s success in adapting to the physical environment puts this very success at risk. We have begun to alter the self-regulating cycles which have provided the stable conditions under which modern societies were able to emerge (Steffen et al. 2011). Our impact on the Earth System is so severe that it threatens to irreversibly changing the state of the Earth System (Steffen et al. 2018). The term Earth System refers to an integrated systems view of earth compromising physical, chemical, biological and human components, and their complex and dynamic interactions (Steffen et al. 2020).\nStability in the Earth System is upheld through regulating biophysical processes (Steffen et al. 2015). They indicate a safe operating space for humanity and reflect early warnings that a system state changing threshold might soon be reached (Steffen et al. 2015). Climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, ocean acidification, atmospheric aerosol loading, land-system change, freshwater use, biochemical flows, biosphere integrity, and novel entities, these are the planetary boundaries. Since the 1950s, in a period dubbed the Great Acceleration, pressure on the planetary boundaries has increased dramatically (Steffen et al. 2011). Two of these boundaries are capable of changing earth system states by themselves: climate change and biosphere integrity (Steffen et al. 2015).\n\n\n3.6.1.2 Forests Hightlight Tradeoffs Inherent in Stewardship\nEnsuring that planetary boundaries are not transgressed, requires that humanity becomes the steward of our planet (Steffen et al. 2011). Stewardship must include managing Earth’s systems at their various levels in a sustainable manner. Ecosystems, are functional units formed by dynamic and complex interactions between their parts (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Like the Earth System at large, ecosystems provide services on which every living being on this planet depends on (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Ecosystem services are the benefits ecosystems provide to people and are categorized into four main categories: 1. supporting services, 2. cultural services, 3. regulating services, and 4. provisional services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005, 40).\nIntervening in an ecosystem is often characterized by trade-offs between different services. Increased provision of wood mass, for example, might limit the extent to which a forest can regulate the water cycle (Himes, Puettmann, and Muraca 2020). Additionally, trade-offs exist also between ecosystems, for example, a more intensely used plantation forest might prevent land-use intensity changes in agricultural or natural forest ecosystems (Himes, Puettmann, and Muraca 2020). For Nordic forests, these trade-offs result in what Högbom et al. (2021) call a trilemma: how to balance biodiversity, climate change mitigation services and increased demand for forest biomass?\nMaking decisions about these trade-offs is complicated as many services lack easy measures (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Some services, such as the provision of materials, on the other hand are easily evaluated. With 80% of Swedish forests subjected to commercial forestry, provisional services are an important factor of the Swedish economy. Genetic and ornamental resources, biochemicals and inputs to (natural) medicines, fresh water, food, fiber and fuel had a total production value of 21.4 billion SEK (2.4 % of GNP) (Hansen and Malmaeus 2016, 5). It is important to keep in mind that ease of measuring service values does automatically make these services necessarily more valuable.\nNew use-cases for forest biomass will increase the pressure on land covered by forests. For example, in a recent paper, Mishra et al. (2022) argue that it would be possible to house 90% of the new urban population by 2100 in wood based buildings. This would save 106 Gt of additional CO2, but increase demand for plantation and natural forest timber. And still, meeting these goals with the available land, without compromising other ecosystem services is challenging. The economic, social and conservation demand for forests in Sweden has been estimated to be 2 to 4 times the currently available land area (Svensson, Neumann, et al. 2020). This pressure is especially pronounced in Northern Sweden where competing interests increase the pressure on forest and society (Svensson et al. 2012). Northern Sweden, along with areas in Finland and Russia, is home to Europe’s last remaining intact forest landscape and high in ecological value (Svensson, Bubnicki, et al. 2020).\n\n3.6.1.2.0.1 Bioeconomy, Bioeconomics – Different Concepts, Different Visions\nAn idea which is bound to increase the pressure and trade-offs between different ecosystem services is the bioeconomy. In recent years the concept has gained relevance among policymakers, practitioners and researchers. The term bioeconomy refers broadly to an economy which uses bio-based inputs instead of fossil based ones. Connected to this are hopes of increased resource efficiency and renewability. In a report commissioned by the Swedish Government, the Swedish Research and Innovation Strategy for a Bio-Based Economy. (2012) defines a vision of a Swedish bioeconomy based on two central pillars. It is to be an economy based on,\n\n[a] sustainable production of biomass to enable increased use within a number of different sectors of society. The objective is to reduce climate effects and the use of fossil-based raw materials.\n\nWith,\n\n[a]n increased added value for biomass materials, concomitant with a reduction in energy consumption and recovery of nutrients and energy as additional end products. The objective is to optimize the value and contribution of ecosystem services to the economy. (p. 9).\n\nThese pillars reflect the two most influential visions the bioeconomy concept. Notions of a bio-technology and bio-resource oriented bioeconomy are widespread and dominate discourse at various levels (Dieken et al. 2021). Despite – or perhaps because of – the bioeconomy lacking a strong definition, it is used to refer to different concepts, with different aims and objectives, foci, normative assumptions and hence implications for society and environment (Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou 2016).\nThe bio-technology vision focuses on economic growth and job provision through the application of bio-technology (Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou 2016). Science driven innovation features prominently in this vision, with collaborations between research institutions in academia and industry taking on an important role (Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou 2016). Vivien et al. (2019) present a review of the concept showing that the focus on science as an absolute motor of change also shaped policy recommendations, driven especially by the OECD, towards increasing the speed and diffusion of innovation through partnerships between new start-ups and establish pharmaceutical companies. As a policy narrative this vision was particularly potent and widespread at the turn of the 21st century. According to them, the intellectual heritage of Schumpeter and Kontradieff play an important role in this vision. Technological breakthroughs are poised to solve economic and ecological challenges, for example through genetic engineering. Consequently, this vision has a weak sustainability notion, viewing sustainability challenges as temporary and nature as substitutable given sufficient research and knowledge creation (Vivien et al. 2019).\nIn more recent years, visions of a bio-resource bioeconomy have taken over as the leading narrative. Unlike the bio-technology vision, this conceptualization does not only focus on economic growth and job creation, but attempts to include ecological sustainability challenges (Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou 2016). Biological resources, not technologies, form the basis of a new economy. In essence, there are two ways in which bio-resources are poised to replace fossil resources: as substitution, e.g., bio-fuels replacing fossil fuels, and as high value added products, e.g., Cross-laminated Timber used as a concrete alternative in construction (Vivien et al. 2019). To substitute fossil resources requires significant efforts in innovation. In contrast to the bio-technology vision, however, innovation is not confined to scientific advances from a narrow biochemical and pharmaceutical field. Instead, new and old actors are required to collaborate between and beyond established sectors (Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou 2016). Although sustainability plays a more important role in this vision of the bioeconomy, this vision is considered an example of weak sustainability (D’Amato et al. 2017; Vivien et al. 2019). The reason is the focus of substitution and high biomass demands. The consumption of raw materials may even increase, not only for bio-based, but also for fossil-based resources (Asada et al. 2020).\nThe exact role played by forests in a bioeconomy transition depends on the desired vision (Kleinschmit et al. 2014). There is no doubt that the Swedish vision places high demands on forests as primary providers of the required biomass. Both in the strategy formulated in Swedish Research and Innovation Strategy for a Bio-Based Economy. (2012) and in public discourse, a small, well-connected group of actors center the bio-resource vision as legitimate and desirable (Holmgren et al. 2022). The result is a forest sector which operates under a “more of everything” paradigm (Beland Lindahl et al. 2015).\n\n\n3.6.1.2.0.2 Innovation for a Bioeconomy\nApart from the substitution of fossil resources through bio-based resources, a central narrative used in the Swedish transition is that, “[t]echnological innovation is key to a greener future” (Holmgren et al. 2022, 42). According to Jankovský et al. (2021) four types of innovation are central for a forest based bioeconomy:\n\nSubstitute Products,\nNew (bio-based) Processes,\nNew (bio-based) Products,\nNew Behavior.\n\nCurrently, most research into bioeconomy innovation relies on patent data or qualitative case studies (e.g., Bennich et al. 2021; Jander and Grundmann 2019). Unfortunately, these approaches are not without their flaws. Focusing on patents could overestimate the importance of the bio-technology vision, whose science oriented innovation approach is driven by patents (Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou 2016). Qualitative case studies, on the other hand, may miss broader trends and features of a bioeconomy transition.\nThe need to capture innovation from a different angle than patents becomes even more urgent when taking the third vision for a bioeconomy into account. Ecological economists refer to it as bioeconomics (Allain et al. 2022), while Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou (2016) list it as the bio-ecology vision. In contrast to the two visions already discussed, this vision prioritizes ecological sustainability over economic interests. The aim is an economy which is compatible with the biosphere (Vivien et al. 2019) and conserves ecosystems (Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou 2016). Vivien et al. (2019) argue that it is therefore incompatible with the other two bioeconomy visions. Central to this stance is the pessimism that the currently dominating bioeconomy visions are continuations of an extractive industrial regime based on false believes regarding the feasibility of substitution and decoupling (Allain et al. 2022). After reviewing the dominant bioeconomy visions and their criticisms, Allain et al. (2022) argue that the debate should take a constructive turn by considering emerging research opportunities.\nThat is what I am doing with my research.

It can be helpful to think about how different functions relate to different sustainability questions. Some questions to keep in mind could be: What assumptions about sustainability (weak versus strong) are made by the innovation systems literature? Are there tradeoffs between the functions of an innovation system and sustainability transitions? How do different functions change in their relation to sustainability over time, e.g., does one and the same function promote sustainability at one point and then limit it at another?\n\n\n\n\nHekkert, M.

    "section": "Simulation Game of Innovation and Sustainability",
    "text": "Simulation Game of Innovation and Sustainability\nThe overall aim of the game is to simulate how an innovation system navigates innovation for sustainability. Each role has their own personal goals in the game. They are stated in the summary table below.\n\nDescription of Game Process\nThe game has ten rounds with one round taking about five minutes. After five rounds there is an election in which you may change your roles. The election is done by simple majority in an open vote.\nOverview of each round:\n\nInnovation goals are set\nInnovators draw cards\nInnovators may play cards\nConsumption\nDiscussion of outcomes and state of game\nNegotiation of innovation goals\n\nThere are two indicators that everyone in the game can see and influence. One representing the economy and one the environment. The environmental indicator ranges from 0 - 10; from completely destroyed to a perfectly intact environment. At the beginning of the game its value is 10. The economy indicator starts at 100 and develops from there. Each round the environmental indicator decreases by 1% (rounded to the nearest integer) of the economy indicator. Since there is no free lunch, the environment degrades by 1 point even if the economy is less than 50 points.\n\nExample: From the outcomes of the first round the economic indicator has grown to 150. Therefore the environmental indicator is decreased by 2 (1.5 rounded up to the nearest full number). Round 2 begins with the indicators at 150 and 8.\n\nOver the course of the game, you will:\n\nfund innovation by deciding how many cards to draw from a deck;\ninnovate by playing matching cards;\nconsume as much as you want.\n\nThe game ends after ten rounds, if the environment is fully depleted, or if the economy is negative for two rounds. Every five rounds, the Government role faces an election. In the election, all citizens get one open vote. If the government is not re-elected, another player can be nominated and voted in instead.\n\n1. Setting Innovation Goals\nAt the beginning of each round, the innovation goals are formulated. While the university researcher is free to set their goals, the company researchers have to follow the orders of the industry player.\n\nExample: Industry decides that they want a new economic product innovation. If the innovators can, they must play a product innovation for the economy in step 3.\n\nAt this step, the industry and the Government also decide how much they want to spend on innovation in this round. One card costs 5 points subtracted from the economic indicator.\n\nExample: The Government decides to spend 10 points. The university researcher gets to draw two cards. Industry decides to spend 20 points, it’s innovators are allowed to draw 4 cards.\n\n\n\n2. Innovators draw cards\nEach innovator draws cards according to their budget. They can decide if from which pile to draw: red stands for product and black for process innovations.\n\n\n3. Innovation\nWhen the innovators have collected a pair of cards in the same color (red, black), they can play them as an innovation. The innovation then adds to the scoreboards. For an economic innovation, twice the sum of the face values is added to the economic indicator (Aces count as 1, J,Q,K as ten). If an environmental innovation is played, only its sum is added, at the same time one point is added to the environmental indicator. If the innovators have both a process and a product at the same time, the effects of the innovation are doubled.\n\nExample: The innovators play the pair 6 of hearts and 6 of diamonds as an economic process innovation. The economic indicator increases by 24 points. The innovators play 4 kings as a radical environmental innovation; 40 points are added to the economic indicator (4*10) and the environment improves by 2.\n\nIf no innovation can be played, the innovators keep the cards they drew in their hands.\n\n\n4. Consumption\nEach round the citizens decide if they want to consume a regular product or an environmental product, adding 5 or 3 points to the economy indicator, respectively. The citizens aim to maximize their consumption in accordance with their environmental preferences stated on their cards. They also have different preferences for the state of the economy.\n\n\n5. Evaluating the Outcomes\nThe effects of all decision during the round are added to the indicators.\n\n\n6. Discussion of Round and Negotiation of Next Round\nEach round ends with an open discussion of the events in the round. Were you satisfied? What should be done next round?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this seminar you will present and discuss your individual reflections on the previous seminars game. The paper should cover a brief explanation of your role in the game, and then use the reading assigned for this seminar to reflect on innovation systems for sustainability transitions. Aim for your reflection to be around 750 words.\nSome questions to help your reflections are:\n\nWhich systems functions, discussed in Hekkert et al. (2007) were fulfilled (how?)? If there were functions that you did not identify, is that due to the game’s design, or some other reason?\nWhat surprised you in the way the game unfolded? Were there critical moments in which the game could have developed differently?\nHow did you find your way into your role? Was it easy for you to adapt to the role, or did you have difficulties? Did you behave the way you did in the game because of the role you assumed? If yes, what made you behave inline with the role? If not, why did you not behave in line with the role?\n\nIt is not important that you answer all of them, or any for that matter. They are meant as guidance rather than expectations. If you have another aspect that you would like to reflect upon, please do. The important part is that you present some thought about innovation systems literature and your personal experience in the first seminar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you could not attend the first seminar, please still try to include personal experience in combination to the assigned reading. Instead of drawing on the game, choose and briefly describe an experience where you were part of an innovation system. You can be liberal with the type of innovation. For example, a student union which aimed to change something at the university; working or interning at a company and wanting to introduce a new tool / process.\nThe goal is that you reflect on how the system influenced this process.\n\n\nDuring the seminar you will first discuss your reflections in small groups of up to five people. Please make sure to read the reflections of others before hand. At the end we will discuss your reflections together.\nApart from the required reading you may find Wieczorek and Hekkert (2012) helpful for a deeper understanding of influencing innovation systems. While the entire book Thinking in Systems: A Primer by Meadows (2009) is a great read, for this reflection you may find chapter 4 Why Systems Surprise Us particularly helpful.\n\n\n\n\nHekkert, M.

A watch and a score board will make the game easier to facilitate.\n\n\n\n\nRole Cards\n\n\n\n\n Download docx file\n\n\nFor each role there is a role card. The government and industry should be given out only once. The other roles can be given out more often. I recommend to play with at least two university and two company researchers. When playing with only ten people, consider giving one citizen the NGO role as a bonus. When playing with 15 players, you may want to add at least one more innovator. The election after round 5 offers the players a chance to obtain a new role. If the government is replaced, the old government becomes a citizen, either trading with the citizen that has been elected as new government or taking the card of whoever replaces the other role. For example, if the industry player is elected as the new government, a citizen replaces them as industry (usually this can be quickly decided through volunteers or through another small election).\n\n\nScore Board\n\n\n\n\n Download xlsx file\n\n\nTo help with keeping score, you can download an excel tool.

    "text": "Game Instructions and Player Rules\nThe game instructions can be found in Seminar 1. While it is not important for students to have a clear understanding of all roles, as facilitator you should be aware of all role’s functions and special features.\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the game arises when students begin to interact with the rules themselves. The instructions do not cover all possible cases and eventualities.\nFor example, the instructions do not specify what else government can do. Usually students quickly think of certain new rules. They may wonder, for example, if government can pass a law which requires a certain number of environmental innovations to be played, such as one every round, or one for every two normal innovations etc.\nThe instructions also do not specify wether or not students can change seats (assuming you play sitting around a table). Or wether the industry roles can fire its researchers, or if they can quit etc.\nDepending on your specific teaching needs, this may even be an asset. However, you are of course free to adapt, add or change rules as you see fit. For example, if you are interested in teaching about the importance of clustering, maybe space out the researcher roles for the first five rounds and only allow them to move afterwards.\nWhile it makes sense to think about some possible extra rules, your students are likely going to surprise you with an idea for a new rule or option during the game anyways.\nOne of the more obvious loopholes that students will ask about is to consume something else than the specified 5, or 3 coins. While I was expecting the environmentally conscious roles to eventually stop consuming all together, I was very amused when an economy-minded citizen asked if they could consume more.\nUse your own judgement in these cases. Part of the fun is to create institutional innovation, such as new rules, but as facilitator make sure that a single change does not destroy the entire mechanism of the game. For example, consuming for 10 instead of 5 may still be a fun new player behavior and is likely to cancel out with other consuming less; consuming for 100 on the other hand may be too much.\nIn the rules it is said that red cards are process and black cards product innovations. This is has no real purpose other than adding some world building to the game."

    "text": "Time Management\nAsk your students to read through the game instructions before coming to the seminar. With some time to cover questions, and a brief repetition of the rules, you have about 50 minutes for the 10 rounds. This means that on average one round should take 5 minutes. As facilitator you should keep an eye on the overall time and try to develop a feeling for the flow of the game. The first rounds will take a bit longer for everyone to settle in. So will round 5 with the election. Use this to your advantage to add some mild stress in other rounds, so that the innovators cannot think too long about which cards to play.\nThe flow of the game is greatly helped if each group (citizens, funding bodies, and researchers) sum up their points for you."

    "text": "Learning Objectives – Sustainability Skills\nHopefully this is not only all fun and games but also teaches some aspects of innovation and sustainability. The assigned reading here is chosen to highlight that innovation is a phenomenon happening embedded in a system. But other readings and points could perhaps also be made with the game. For example, if you are more interested in the geography of innovation, perhaps a paper about spillover effects together with new rules regarding the seating arrangements works better for you.\nHere are some questions that can be used directly after the game and in a follow up seminar, after students have read the assigned paper. It is of course also possible to require the reading before the game is played and have the discussions directly following the game.\nApart from the topical knowledge, these questions also focus on other sustainability competencies (Brundiers et al. 2021).\n\nPost Game Questions\n\nWhat happened?\nHow did you feel in your role?\nDo you feel you “won”?\nWhat moment was decisive for the game outcome?\nWhat were you thinking about the other players in the game?\nDid something that could have happened not happen (e.g., the government passing laws? Citizens stopping to consume at all?) Why or why not?\n\n\n\nQuestions for Seminar 2\n\nSmall GroupLarge Group\n\n\n\nQuestions on the Reflection\n\nHow was it to reflect on the game? What came easy, what did not?\nWere you surprised by something in the reflections you read?\nIf you had the same (or similar) roles, do you recognize the others experiences? Where are your own reflections different? Why do you think this is the case?\nIf you had different roles, do the reflections fit into what you thought about the other persons role both during and after the game?\n\n\n\nQuestions on System Functions\n\nDo you agree with the analysis of systems functions in your small group?\nAre there functions that you struggle with (in understanding or in applying)?\n\n\n\n\n\nDid others in your small group feel different about the easiness of reflection than you did?\nHow similar were your reflections in the small groups?\nHas your discussion prompted some new insight, either regarding your own reflection or the system function?\n\n\nQuestions on System Functions\n\nIf we think back to the iceberg heuristic, can we identify new or different ways in which functions were fulfilled?\nWhat knowledge was developed in the game? By whom and when?\nHow is knowledge diffused both in the game and in reality?\nWhat would have happened if one (or both) of the indicators were more delayed?\nWhat would have been needed to have a different game?\nHow aware were you of the game mechanisms during the game versus after? What changed?"

The game can certainly be improved in many ways, one of the most obvious ones is to include some sort of market mechanism for doing more with the innovations that are played. That or any other ideas for future improvements are very welcome.\n\n\n\n\nBrundiers, Katja, Matthias Barth, Gisela Cebrián, Matthew Cohen, Liliana Diaz, Sonya Doucette-Remington, Weston Dripps, et al. 2021. “Key Competencies in Sustainability in Higher Education—Toward an Agreed-Upon Reference Framework.” Sustainability Science 16 (1): 13–29. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00838-2."
